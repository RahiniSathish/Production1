# 🚀 MCP & Flight Booking Integration Summary

## ✅ What Was Added to `agent.py`

### 1. **MCP Integration (Lines 41-62)**
```python
MCP_AVAILABLE = False
try:
    from mcp_client import get_live_flights_for_ai, get_flight_status_for_ai, search_airports_for_ai, mcp_client
    if mcp_client.health_check():
        MCP_AVAILABLE = True
        logger.info("✅ MCP Flight Data Server is available")
    else:
        logger.warning("⚠️ MCP Server is not responding")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"⚠️ MCP integration unavailable: {e}")
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Live flight search between airports
- ✅ Flight status tracking by flight number
- ✅ Airport search by city/location

---

### 2. **Backend Booking Integration (Lines 221-243)**
```python
async def _create_flight_booking(self, booking_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create flight booking via backend API"""
    url = f"{self.backend_url}/create_flight_booking"
    # POSTs booking to FastAPI backend
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Async booking creation
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Returns booking confirmation ID

---

### 3. **Comprehensive Travel Agent Instructions (Lines 278-494)**

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **NO GREETING RULE**: Agent waits for user to speak first
- ✅ **ENGLISH-ONLY**: Strict English communication policy
- ✅ **SOPHISTICATED QUESTIONS**: Detailed, conversational prompts (not "Destination?")
- ✅ **PATIENT COMMUNICATION**: One question at a time, wait for answers
- ✅ **CONTEXT MEMORY**: Remembers trip goals throughout conversation
- ✅ **10-STEP BOOKING FLOW**: 
  1. Departure location
  2. Destination  
  3. Flight name/airline
  4. Departure time
  5. Departure date
  6. Round trip or one-way
  7. Number of travelers
  8. Class (Economy/Business/First)
  9. Seat preference (Window/Aisle)
  10. Meal preference (Veg/Non-veg/Vegan)

**Example Sophisticated Question:**
> "I'd be delighted to help you with your flight booking. Could you tell me which city or airport you'll be departing from, and if there's any specific terminal or location preference you have?"

Instead of: ❌ "Departure location?"

---

### 4. **Flight Function Definitions (Lines 496-622)**

**Core Booking Function:**
```python
{
    "name": "create_flight_booking",
    "description": "Create a flight booking after user confirms all details",
    "parameters": {
        "customer_email", "departure_location", "destination",
        "flight_name", "departure_time", "departure_date",
        "return_date", "num_travelers", "service_details",
        "seat_preference", "meal_preference", "arrival_time"
    }
}
```

**MCP Functions (if MCP_AVAILABLE):**
1. `get_live_flights` - Real-time flight search
2. `get_flight_status` - Track specific flights
3. `search_airports` - Find airports by city

---

### 5. **Function Call Handlers (Lines 750-840)**

**Booking Handler:**
```python
@agent.function_registry.register("create_flight_booking")
async def handle_create_booking(...):
    # Collects all booking details
    # POSTs to backend
    # Returns confirmation ID
```

**MCP Handlers (if available):**
- `handle_get_live_flights`
- `handle_get_flight_status`  
- `handle_search_airports`

---

### 6. **Echo Fix (Still Active)**
- ✅ `use_tts_aligned_transcript=False` (Line 659)
- ✅ Message deduplication with `processed_messages` set (Lines 629, 712-721)

## 🔧 How to Enable MCP Flight Data

### Option 1: Use Existing MCP Server
If you have an MCP server running on port 8080:
```bash
# MCP server should be running
# agent.py will auto-detect it
```

### Option 2: Disable MCP (Uses Instructions Only)
If MCP is not available, the agent works perfectly fine using:
- AI-generated flight suggestions
- Booking flow still works
- No real-time data, but conversations still natural
